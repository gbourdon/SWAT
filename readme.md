# SWAT
## Super Windows Audit Tool
### SWAT checks to see if the machine it runs on conforms to CyberPatriot standards (Currently using [this](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cpvii/Training+materials/Unit+Five+-+Microsoft+Windows+Security.pdf) standard)

## How to use
Run the tool as Administrator, and it will check to see if there are any issues. If there are, it will display them in red at the bottom of the output.

## Can this fix out said issues?
Not yet, but it might soon.

## What does this check for?
### Working on
- Minimum and Maximum password age
- Minimum password length
- Password History Length
- Any users without passwords
- Lists all administrators and warns if there are more than two (including the built in account)
### Soon
- If the built in Guest and Administrator accounts are enabled
- Complexity Requirements
- Reversible encryption
- Locking out accounts after too many failed logon attempts
